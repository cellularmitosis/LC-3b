# LC-3b programs
Here are some programs I have written related to the [LC-3b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3) (Little Computer 3b), which is a simple CPU architecture intended as a teaching tool.

## Book

The LC-3 was described in the book [Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computing-Systems-Gates-Beyond/dp/0072467509) [(errata)](http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/information_center_view0/errata_page.html).  The LC-3b appears to be the same CPU, but with the addition of a bit-shifting instruction.
